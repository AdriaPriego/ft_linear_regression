# ft_linear_regression

An introduction to machine learning.

## Description

`ft_linear_regression` is a project designed to introduce the basics of machine learning, specifically focusing on linear regression. Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python (version 3.6 or higher).
- You have installed the necessary dependencies (see Installation section).

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdriaPriego/ft_linear_regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ft_linear_regression
```

3. Train the model by running the `ft_lineal_regresion.py` script:

```bash
python ft_lineal_regresion.py
```

This script will train the linear regression model and generate a file with the model parameters.

4. Use the generated model parameters to estimate prices by running the `estimatePrice.py` script:

```bash
python estimatePrice.py
```

## Examples

Here is an example of how to use the scripts:

1. Train the model:

```bash
python ft_lineal_regresion.py
```

2. Estimate prices using the trained model:

```bash
python estimatePrice.py
```
